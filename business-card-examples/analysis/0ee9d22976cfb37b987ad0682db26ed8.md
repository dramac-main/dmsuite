# Business Card Analysis: 0ee9d22976cfb37b987ad0682db26ed8.jpg
## PIXEL-PERFECT CANVAS2D RECREATION SPEC

> **Source Image**: 640×640px square composite mockup showing both front and back cards overlapping on a dark background. Cards displayed at slight angles in perspective/3D mockup style. All measurements below are normalized to standard business card proportions (3.5:2 / 1.75:1).

---

## IMAGE STRUCTURE NOTE

This is **not** a flat scan — it's a **3D mockup composite** with:
- Both cards overlapping in center of frame
- Slight drop shadows / ambient occlusion
- Dark background surrounding both cards
- Front card positioned upper-left, back card lower-right
- Cards overlap in the center (~40-60% of image vertically)

All percentage positions below are **re-normalized** to individual card dimensions for Canvas2D recreation.

// Lobe 1: sweep left to leftmost point
ctx.bezierCurveTo(
  cardW * 0.70, cardH * 0.40,   // CP1
  cardW * 0.50, cardH * 0.46,   // CP2
  cardW * 0.41, cardH * 0.54    // End: leftmost point
);

// Lobe 2: sharp right kick then sweep left again
ctx.bezierCurveTo(
  cardW * 0.60, cardH * 0.58,   // CP1: sharp right kick
  cardW * 0.50, cardH * 0.62,   // CP2
  cardW * 0.53, cardH * 0.64    // End: second lobe apex
);

// Exit: sweep back right off card
ctx.bezierCurveTo(
  cardW * 0.60, cardH * 0.68,   // CP1
  cardW * 0.80, cardH * 0.80,   // CP2
  cardW, cardH * 0.88           // End: exit right edge
);

// Close along right edge
ctx.lineTo(cardW, cardH * 0.36);
ctx.closePath();
ctx.fillStyle = '#2DB5E5';
ctx.fill();
```

#### Wave Fill:
- Fill color: `#2DB5E5` (use single flat color for Canvas2D, or subtle radial gradient)
- Optional gradient: brighter `#2FBBEC` at center → darker `#22A8DD` at edges
- The wave **fills from its left boundary curve all the way to the right edge of the card**

## DESIGN DNA — WHY THE WAVE WORKS

### Wave Geometry:
The wave is an **organic S-curve with two lobes** — NOT a simple sine wave or single arc.

1. **Asymmetric double-lobe**: First lobe reaches deeper into card (~41% from left). Second lobe is shallower (~53%). This creates visual rhythm and prevents monotony.

2. **Sharp inflection at y=57-58%**: The wave briefly retreats RIGHT before sweeping LEFT again — this "pinch point" adds energy, motion, and a sense of fluidity.

3. **Tapered entry/exit**: Wave enters and exits tangent to the right card edge, creating a seamless "flowing through" effect — as if the card is a window into a larger flowing surface.

4. **Content-wave spatial relationship**:
   - All text sits in the DARK zone (left ~35% of card)
   - The wave acts as a curtain/divider
   - Logo + text positioned in "safe zone" before wave reaches
   - Creates natural reading area with calm dark background
   - On back side: wave mirrors from LEFT → content pushed RIGHT

5. **Complementary mirroring**: Front wave enters RIGHT → sweeps LEFT. Back wave enters LEFT → sweeps RIGHT. When both sides are seen together, this creates visual cohesion and bilateral symmetry.

### Surface Area:
- Cyan wave occupies roughly **30-35%** of front card surface
- Enough to be visually dominant without overwhelming text content
- Creates a ~65/35 split (dark/cyan)

### Contrast Ratios:
- Dark bg to cyan: ~80% brightness jump — extremely dramatic
- White text on dark: WCAG AAA compliant
- White text on cyan: WCAG AA compliant
