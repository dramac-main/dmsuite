---

## FRONT SIDE (Dark)

### Background
- **Type**: Subtle horizontal gradient — darker left, lighter right
- **NOT a flat color** — measured gradient across card width:
  - x=5%: `#292a2c` (R=41, G=42, B=44) — darkest
  - x=15%: `#2c2d2f` (R=44, G=45, B=47)
  - x=25%: `#2f3032` (R=47, G=48, B=50)
  - x=35%: `#353638` (R=53, G=54, B=56)
  - x=45%: `#393a3c` (R=57, G=58, B=60)
  - x=55%: `#3c3d3f` (R=60, G=61, B=63)
  - x=65%: `#3f4042` (R=63, G=64, B=66)
  - x=75%: `#4a4b4d` (R=74, G=75, B=77) — brightest point (light reflection)
  - x=85%: `#454648` (R=69, G=70, B=72)
  - x=95%: `#3d3e40` (R=61, G=62, B=64)
- **Canvas2D gradient**: `createLinearGradient(0, 0, cardWidth, 0)` from `#292a2c` → `#4a4b4d` with soft falloff
- **Best simplified gradient stops**: 0% `#292a2c`, 75% `#4a4b4d`, 100% `#3d3e40`
- **Overall color description**: Charcoal / dark graphite with subtle left-to-right luminance ramp
- **Note**: There is also a subtle cool-blue tint (B channel is consistently 2-3 higher than R)

### Diagonal Reflection Band (Bottom)
- **Type**: Glossy surface reflection — diagonal band from bottom-left corner sweeping to right edge
- **Starts**: At approximately y=85% of card height
- **Behavior**: Card remains dark (#27282a to #3f4042) up to y≈85%, then rapidly lightens
- **Gradient at y=87%**: Left `#5a5b5d`, Center `#595a5c`, Right `#808183`
- **Gradient at y=93%**: Left `#828385`, Center `#898a8c`, Right `#c0c1c3`
- **Gradient at y=99%**: Left `#a8a9ab`, Center `#b4b5b7`, Right `#d6d7d9`
- **Direction**: Brightens more on the right side → diagonal bottom-right origin
- **Canvas2D implementation**: Second overlaid gradient from bottom-right corner, semi-transparent white, or use `createLinearGradient` at ~135° angle from `rgba(255,255,255,0)` at y=85% to `rgba(255,255,255,0.35)` at y=100%

### Monogram Logo (Centerpiece)
- **Position center**: (50.1%, 43.4%) of card — slightly above vertical center
- **Bounding box**: x=36.1%–64.1%, y=27.8%–59.0% of card
- **Size**: 28.0% of card width × 31.2% of card height
- **Aspect ratio**: Nearly square (slightly taller than wide in card space, but because card is 1.75:1, actual shape is wider than tall)

#### Monogram Construction (Geometric "AV" Interlock)
- **Letters**: "A" and "V" interlocked in isometric/3D perspective
- **Shape**: The monogram forms a **diamond/rhombus** overall silhouette when viewed at distance
- **3D illusion**: Two flat ribbon-like parallelogram bands weave through each other:
  - **Band 1** ("A" stroke): Runs from upper-left down to lower-center, then angles right — forms the left leg
  - **Band 2** ("V" stroke): Runs from upper-right down to lower-center, then angles left — forms the right leg
  - The bands appear to pass **over and under** each other at crossing points, creating an impossible/Penrose-like interlocking effect
- **Ribbon width**: Each band is approximately 5-6% of card width (uniform thickness)
- **Number of crossings**: 2-3 distinct over/under intersections
- **Inner structure**: The interlocking creates triangular negative-space cutouts within the diamond shape

#### Hatching Pattern (Inside Monogram)
- **Type**: Diagonal parallel lines filling the letter shapes
- **Angle**: 45° (top-left to bottom-right diagonal)
- **Line spacing**: ~4.0 px average in image (≈ 0.93% of card width)
- **Line width**: ~2 px bright line, ~2 px dark gap (50% duty cycle)
- **Line color**: White to near-white `#e9eaeb` average, peaks at `#ffffff`
- **Gap color**: Same as card background (transparent — the dark card shows through)
- **Pattern is uniform**: Same angle, spacing, and weight across all parts of both letter strokes
- **Canvas2D implementation**:
  1. Create the letter shapes as paths
  2. Clip to those paths
  3. Draw diagonal lines at 45° with spacing ≈ 1% of card width
  4. Line stroke: `#ffffff`, lineWidth ≈ 0.5% of card width

#### Monogram Color
- **Line color**: `#ffffff` (pure white) for the hatching strokes
- **Average perceived color**: `#e9eaeb` (due to mixing with dark background between lines)
- **No solid fill** — the entire monogram is rendered purely through the hatching lines

### Text Elements (Front)
- **NONE** — The front side has no text whatsoever. It is exclusively the monogram on dark background.

### Decorative Elements (Front)
- No borders, rules, or ornamental elements
- Only the monogram + background + reflection band

---

## DESIGN DNA — What Makes It Premium

### 1. The Hatching Technique
- The monogram is NOT a solid fill — it's rendered entirely through 45° diagonal parallel lines
- This mimics **engraving** or **etching** — traditional printmaking techniques associated with luxury
- The hatching creates a shimmering, textured quality that solid color cannot achieve
- On screen: renders as a moire-resistant pattern when spacing is calibrated correctly
- **Canvas2D tip**: Use `ctx.setLineDash([])` with rotated context and clipped paths

### 2. The Geometric Construction
- Two ribbon-like bands interlocking in an impossible/Penrose fashion
- Creates visual intrigue — the eye tries to follow each band through the crossings
- The over/under illusion suggests depth on a flat surface
- Diamond-shaped overall silhouette = stability, quality, precision

### 3. Extreme Contrast Strategy
- **Front**: Dark (#2c2d2f) + White (#ffffff) — maximum contrast, pure drama
- **Back**: White (#fafbfd) + Near-black (#1c1d1e) — reversed but equally bold
- **Within back**: 3-level gray hierarchy (name #1c → title #83 → contact #7a)
- The front/back flip creates a **yin-yang duality** — sophisticated paired presentation

### 4. Typographic Restraint
- Single font family throughout — unity
- Weight variation (Light → Regular → Bold) instead of multiple fonts
- Very wide letter-spacing on title = understated elegance
- ALL CAPS throughout = geometric consistency matching the sans-serif letterforms

### 5. Negative Space Mastery
- Front: 70%+ of card is pure dark background — the monogram "floats" in space
- Back: Large gap between name block and contact block — unhurried, confident
- Watermark fills the "empty" space without adding visual weight

### 6. The Reflection Band
- Simulates a **spot UV or gloss varnish** finish
- Suggests premium print finishing (matte card stock with gloss-varnished logo area)
- Creates photographic realism in the studio shot

---

## CANVAS2D RENDERING ORDER

### Front Side
1. Fill background gradient: `createLinearGradient(0, 0, w, 0)` with stops `#292a2c` → `#4a4b4d` → `#3d3e40`
2. Draw reflection band: Semi-transparent white gradient from bottom-right at ~135°, starting at y=85%
3. Construct monogram letter paths (A + V interlocking geometry)
4. Clip to monogram paths
5. Draw 45° hatching lines: white (#ffffff), line width ≈ 0.5% card width, spacing ≈ 1% card width
6. Restore clip

### Back Side
1. Fill background: `#f8f9fb` (solid near-white)
2. Construct large watermark monogram paths (same geometry as front, scaled ~2.3x)
3. Position watermark at center (~67%, 45%)
4. Clip to watermark paths
5. Draw 45° hatching lines: `#b9baba`, same proportional spacing
6. Restore clip
7. Draw name text: "ROB SIMAX", bold 700, geometric sans, `#1c1d1e`, at (9.3%, 12.7%)
8. Draw title text: "ARTIST", light 300, geometric sans, `#828385`, letter-spacing 0.25em, at (9.3%, 20.4%)
9. Draw address: "BOULEVARD 01234", light 300, `#828385`, at (8.8%, 77.6%)
10. Draw contact line 1: address details left-aligned, phone right-aligned, regular 400, `#797a7c`, at y=82.9%
11. Draw contact line 2: email left-aligned, website right-aligned, regular 400, `#797a7c`, at y=88.6%

## MONOGRAM GEOMETRY CONSTRUCTION GUIDE

### Conceptual Shape
The monogram is two flat **parallelogram ribbons** that weave through each other:

```
        /\
       /  \          <- Top apex (V point)
      / /\ \
     / /  \ \        <- Bands begin to separate
    / / /\ \ \
   / / /  \ \ \      <- Maximum width / crossing zone
    \ \ \/ / /
     \ \/\/ /        <- Bands cross over/under
      \ /\ /
       \/  \/        <- Bottom split / A spread
        \  /
         \/          <- Bottom apex (A point)
```

### Isometric Ribbon Construction
1. **Band A** (left-leaning): Starts top-center, descends at ~30° to the left, turns back right at bottom
2. **Band B** (right-leaning): Starts top-center, descends at ~30° to the right, turns back left at bottom
3. At each crossing: One band passes IN FRONT, the other BEHIND — alternating at each intersection
4. Each band has a consistent width of about 5-6% of card width
5. The overall silhouette is a **diamond/rhombus** oriented vertically

### Key Angles
- Band slope: approximately 60° from horizontal (steep lean)
- Hatching lines: exactly 45° (independent of band angle)
- Overall monogram aspect: roughly 0.9:1 (width:height in card space)
