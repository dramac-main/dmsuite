## FRONT SIDE

### OVERALL COMPOSITION
A **multi-angle zigzag diagonal split** divides the card into a dark left polygon and light right section. This is NOT a simple straight diagonal -- it is a complex angular path with **5 distinct angle-change segments** creating a dramatic geometric composition with chevron-like notches.

### THE ANGULAR DIVIDING PATH (Canvas2D Polygon Coordinates)
The dark-light boundary traces this path (all values as % of card width/height):

| Segment | From | To | Angle | Description |
|---------|------|----|-------|-------------|
| 1 - Gentle lean | (43%, 0%) | (46%, 20%) | ~82 deg from horiz | Nearly vertical, very slight rightward lean |
| 2 - Sharp chevron | (46%, 20%) | (29%, 30%) | ~30 deg from horiz | Steep leftward cut creating arrow/notch |
| 3 - Narrow hold | (29%, 30%) | (30%, 38%) | ~83 deg from horiz | Nearly vertical, holds narrow |
| 4 - Step right | (30%, 38%) | (49%, 39%) | ~5 deg from horiz | Horizontal step/jump to the right |
| 5 - Steep sweep | (49%, 39%) | (15%, 63%) | ~55 deg from horiz | Dramatic leftward diagonal sweep |
| 6 - Step right | (15%, 63%) | (47%, 64%) | ~3 deg from horiz | Sharp horizontal step back right |
| 7 - Gentle lean | (47%, 64%) | (57%, 100%) | ~74 deg from horiz | Gentle rightward lean to bottom |

**Canvas2D dark polygon path (left side):**
```javascript
// All coordinates as fractions of cardWidth (cw) and cardHeight (ch)
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(0, 0);                         // top-left corner
ctx.lineTo(0.43 * cw, 0);                 // along top to boundary start
ctx.lineTo(0.46 * cw, 0.20 * ch);         // Seg 1: gentle lean right
ctx.lineTo(0.29 * cw, 0.30 * ch);         // Seg 2: sharp chevron cut left
ctx.lineTo(0.30 * cw, 0.38 * ch);         // Seg 3: narrow hold
ctx.lineTo(0.49 * cw, 0.39 * ch);         // Seg 4: step right
ctx.lineTo(0.15 * cw, 0.63 * ch);         // Seg 5: steep diagonal sweep left
ctx.lineTo(0.47 * cw, 0.64 * ch);         // Seg 6: step right
ctx.lineTo(0.57 * cw, 1.00 * ch);         // Seg 7: gentle lean to bottom
ctx.lineTo(0, ch);                         // bottom-left corner
ctx.closePath();
ctx.fillStyle = '#232323';
ctx.fill();
```

**White accent strip:** A thin white triangular strip (~4-5% width) runs along the TOP portion of the boundary (Segments 1-2), from x~43-47.5% at y=0% narrowing to a point at y~20%. This creates a highlight/separation between sections.

```javascript
// White accent triangle along top boundary
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(0.43 * cw, 0);                 // left edge of strip at top
ctx.lineTo(0.475 * cw, 0);                // right edge at top (~4.5% wide)
ctx.lineTo(0.46 * cw, 0.20 * ch);         // tapers to point at 20% height
ctx.closePath();
ctx.fillStyle = '#FFFFFF';
ctx.fill();
```

## BACK SIDE

### OVERALL COMPOSITION
The back card is a **mirror-complement** of the front. It features THREE distinct zones: light-left/dark-right at top, a full-width dark band in the center (housing the logo), and dark-left/light-right at bottom. Steep diagonal transitions connect these zones.

### THE ANGULAR DIVIDING PATH -- BACK CARD

**Zone 1 -- Top split (y: 0-28%):**
- Light panel: LEFT side, from x: 0% to ~35% (top) expanding to ~38% (at y=28%)
- Dark panel: RIGHT side, from x: ~35% to 100%
- Boundary lean: ~82 deg from horizontal (gentle rightward, +1% width per 8% height)

**Zone 2 -- Steep diagonal collapse (y: 28-46%):**
- The light panel on the left rapidly shrinks from 38% width down to 0%
- Boundary runs from (x=38%, y=28%) to (x=0%, y=46%)
- Angle: ~65 deg from horizontal (steep leftward cut)
- Creates a dramatic triangular vanishing of the light section

**Zone 3 -- Full dark band (y: 46-72%):**
- The ENTIRE card width is dark #232323
- No light section visible
- The **geometric logo** sits centered in this full-dark band (y: 48-65%)
- This creates maximum visual focus on the logo mark

**Zone 4 -- Steep diagonal emergence (y: 65-72%):**
- A light panel appears on the RIGHT side
- Boundary runs from approximately (x=78%, y=65%) to (x=62%, y=72%)
- The light section rapidly expands from 0% to ~38% width
- Mirror of Zone 2's collapse

**Zone 5 -- Bottom split (y: 72-100%):**
- Dark panel: LEFT side, x: 0% to ~62% (at y=72%) expanding to ~65% (bottom)
- Light panel: RIGHT side, x: ~62% to 100%
- Boundary lean: ~84 deg from horizontal (very gentle rightward)

**Canvas2D dark polygon path (back card):**
```javascript
// The dark area is one complex polygon
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(0.35 * cw, 0);                 // top split boundary
ctx.lineTo(cw, 0);                         // top-right corner
ctx.lineTo(cw, 0.65 * ch);                // right edge to emergence point
ctx.lineTo(0.62 * cw, 0.72 * ch);         // diagonal in to bottom split
ctx.lineTo(0.65 * cw, ch);                // gentle lean to bottom
ctx.lineTo(0, ch);                          // bottom-left corner
ctx.lineTo(0, 0.46 * ch);                 // left edge up to collapse end
ctx.lineTo(0.38 * cw, 0.28 * ch);         // steep diagonal to top split
ctx.closePath();
ctx.fillStyle = '#232323';
ctx.fill();

// Light areas are the remaining space (fill light first, then dark on top)
```

### GEOMETRIC LOGO -- BACK CARD CENTER

**Location:** Centered in the full-dark band
- **Overall bounds:** x: 35-67%, y: 48-65% of card
- **Center point:** approximately x: 50%, y: 57%
- **Total footprint:** ~32% of card width x ~17% of card height

**Logo structure:** Abstract geometric cross/X pattern formed by two intersecting thin diagonal lines in white (#FFFFFF):

**Line A (Upper-left to lower-right tendency):**
- Traces from approximately (x=50%, y=48%) diagonally down-left to (x=35%, y=61%)
- Thin stroke: ~1% of card width (~4px)
- Color: #FFFFFF

**Line B (Upper-right to lower-left tendency):**
- Traces from approximately (x=67%, y=50%) diagonally down-left to (x=46%, y=65%)
- Thin stroke: ~1% of card width
- Color: #FFFFFF

**Intersection point:** ~x=50%, y=55%
- The two lines cross here forming the X/cross mark
- Additional small satellite marks/dots around the intersection at:
  - (x=50-51%, y=53%) -- small accent mark
  - (x=59-60%, y=53-54%) -- small accent mark

**Style:** Thin, precise, architectural line work. The logo looks like a minimalist geometric monogram or abstract compass/asterisk mark.

### TYPOGRAPHY -- BACK CARD

#### "COMPANY" text
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Text** | COMPANY |
| **Position** | x: 55-65%, y: 55-60% (right of and slightly below logo center) |
| **Font** | Same sans-serif geometric as front |
| **Weight** | Bold / 700 |
| **Size** | ~4% of card height |
| **Case** | UPPERCASE |
| **Letter-spacing** | Wide / 0.15em |
| **Color** | #FFFFFF (white on dark background) |
| **Context** | Horizontally aligned with the right portion of the geometric logo mark |

### BACKGROUND COLORS -- BACK
Identical to front card palette. #232323 for all dark areas, #E2E2E2 for all light areas. Perfect chromatic consistency across both sides.

## COLOR PALETTE

| Swatch | Hex | RGB | Role | Usage |
|--------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| Charcoal | #232323 | (35, 35, 35) | Primary dark | Dark panels on both sides, text on light bg |
| Warm Off-White | #E2E2E2 | (226, 226, 226) | Primary light | Light panels on both sides |
| Pure White | #FFFFFF | (255, 255, 255) | Accent / text | Text on dark bg, accent triangle, logo lines |

**Total palette: 3 colors.** Extreme monochromatic minimalism. The design achieves all its visual impact through geometry alone, with only tonal contrast (not hue contrast) between the 3 values.

**Contrast ratios:**
- #FFFFFF on #232323: ~13.5:1 (exceeds WCAG AAA)
- #232323 on #E2E2E2: ~8.5:1 (exceeds WCAG AAA)
- #FFFFFF on #E2E2E2: ~1.6:1 (decorative only, not for readable text)

## DESIGN DNA

### What Makes This Angular Design Work

1. **Multi-angle zigzag vs. simple diagonal:** Instead of a single straight diagonal, the dark-light boundary has **7 segments with 6 angle changes**, creating visual dynamism and energy. The chevron notch at y~20-30% is the signature element -- it creates a natural "shelf" for the name text while adding geometric interest.

2. **Asymmetric balance:** The dark section occupies ~43% at top but varies wildly (down to ~15% mid-card, up to ~57% at bottom). The eye is constantly engaged following the angular path. Despite the complexity, the overall visual weight feels balanced because the larger dark areas at top/bottom bracket the compressed center.

3. **Extreme chromatic restraint:** Only 3 tonal values (#232323, #E2E2E2, #FFFFFF). This forces the geometry to do ALL the visual heavy-lifting. No color distractions. The ~13.5:1 contrast ratio between white text and dark background ensures maximum legibility.

4. **Front-back geometric complementarity:** The back card is the geometric INVERSE of the front:
   - Front: Dark LEFT side with rightward zigzag boundary
   - Back: Light LEFT (top) -> full dark -> Dark LEFT (bottom, with rightward boundary)
   - The diagonal angles on the back MIRROR the front's angles, creating visual harmony when both sides are seen together

5. **Text-geometry integration:** The name "HENRY SOAZ" is placed precisely in the chevron notch where the dark section widens -- the geometry literally frames and presents the name. The large angled repeat on the light section adds boldness and echoes the card's angular theme.

6. **The full-dark band (back card center):** Having the entire card go dark for y=46-72% is a power move -- it forces the geometric logo to be the sole focus, floating in pure dark space with zero visual competition. This 26% height band is perfectly proportioned.

7. **Diagonal energy vs. horizontal stability:** Contact information remains strictly horizontal (stable, readable) while the geometric boundaries are diagonal (dynamic, energetic). This tension between order and movement is the design's fundamental tension.

8. **Repeating angle language:** The ~30 deg and ~55 deg angles appear in both the front chevron cut, the steep sweep, the back diagonal collapse, and even in the large angled name rotation. This consistent angle vocabulary creates visual coherence despite the complexity.

### Canvas2D Recreation Priority Notes
- All diagonal edges must be **razor-sharp** -- no rounded corners, no soft gradients, no blur
- The white accent triangle along Segment 1 is subtle but critical for depth
- Anti-aliasing on diagonal lines is important for clean rendering at any resolution
- The geometric logo on the back is thin-line work (~1% card width strokes) -- precision matters
- Text rendering should use `textBaseline = 'top'` for consistent positioning
- The large angled name on the front requires `ctx.rotate()` with `ctx.save()`/`ctx.restore()`
- Contact icons should be drawn as simple path-based icons, not font glyphs

### Key Proportional Relationships
- Dark-to-light area ratio (front): approximately 48:52 (nearly equal)
- Dark-to-light area ratio (back): approximately 70:30 (dark dominant)
- Name text height: 2.5x title text height
- Contact text size: same as title text size
- Logo height: ~1.7x name text height
- Full dark band height (back): ~26% = roughly 1/4 of card height
- Top/bottom light panels (back): ~28% each = symmetrical bookends
